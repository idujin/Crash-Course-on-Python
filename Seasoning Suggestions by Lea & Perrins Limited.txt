Lea & Perrins' Sauce is manufactured from the choicest ingredients
collected from various countries and scientifically blended under the
most sanitary conditions.

It has earned its world-wide reputation by always maintaining the
highest standard of quality through several generations.

Messrs. Lea & Perrins alone hold the recipe for manufacturing the
original Worcestershire Sauce, and the flavor and quality of their
sauce is the recognized standard throughout the world.

It is known in South Africa, in India, in far China and Japan, in South
America, in Canada, as well as America.

It stands on the tables of every-equipped dinning car, steamship
line, luxurious hotel and in millions of homes: the housekeeper also
uses it in cooking to give zest and unequalled flavor to the simple but
delicious dishes which she prepares at home.

Every bottle of the original Worcestershire Sauce bears their
signature, thus:

If Lea & Perrins' signature does not appear on the wrapper and label,
it is not the original Worcestershire.

When ordering sauce, order by the name "Lea & Perrins" and thus get the
original Worcestershire.

                       THE NEW DINNER APPETIZER

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_


"But, isn't there something new to serve at the beginning of a dinner
in place of fruit, or soup, or oysters, or the now prohibited cocktail?"

Yes--there is--something new and delicious and different. It is the new
"dinner appetizer"--the piquancy and "punch" of which come from the
delicious appetizer dressing--seasoned with =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.

This Appetizer Dressing is made by combining in the proper proportions,
the finest table catsup with the finest table sauce--=Lea & Perrins'
Sauce=--the original Worcestershire. It is the zest--the inimitable
flavor and the unequalled seasoning power--of =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce= which makes these new first courses for dinner worthy of the
"Dinner Appetizer" name.

These new Dinner Appetizers are not only inexpensive and easy to
prepare at home, but they seem to surround the home table with the
attractive and costly atmosphere of the most luxurious hotel.

A wine, cocktail, sundae or other glass is placed in the center of a
small plate. The appetizer--tomato, devilled egg, mushroom, shrimp,
beet or olive--is arranged on lettuce leaves on the plate around
the glass, and the glass is filled with the appetizer dressing.
These are placed with an oyster or other fork on a service plate at
each individual cover just before dinner is announced and create an
attractive and appetizing impression as each guest enters the dining
room. Each appetizer and lettuce leaf is dipped in the Appetizer
Dressing just before it is eaten.

To vary the arrangement of these dinner appetizers the Appetizer
Dressing may be served in a tomato shell, or a green pepper case from
which all seeds and pulp have been removed, or in a little cup cut from
bread, and fried in deep fat for forty seconds to brown and harden the
surface.


                          APPETIZER DRESSING

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    2 teaspoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    4 tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup.

   For every individual service desired, use the above proportions of
   =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= and tomato catsup. Add the =Lea &
   Perrins'= to the catsup, blend well, and put in the ice-box to
   chill.

   Place this dressing in a chilled cocktail, sundae or other glass in
   the center of a small plate and serve surrounding with crisp lettuce
   leaves on which tomato, devilled egg, shrimp, sardine or other
   attractive dinner appetizers have been arranged. The lettuce and
   appetizers are dipped in the dressing with an oyster fork and eaten.


                           TOMATO APPETIZER

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   One tomato may be used for two services. Put the tomatoes in
   a wire strainer and quickly dip in and out of boiling water.
   Place immediately in cold water and peel. Place on ice to chill
   thoroughly. When ready to serve, quarter each tomato and recut each
   quarter into two or three parts, depending on the size. Arrange
   these on crisp lettuce leaves around a cocktail, sundae or other
   glass containing the Appetizer Dressing. Serve with an oyster fork.
   Dip each tomato and leaf in the Appetizer Dressing just before
   eating.


                        DEVILLED EGG APPETIZER

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Use one hard-cooked egg for each individual service. Cut the egg in
   half and remove the yolk to a bowl. Add 1 tablespoonful of grated
   cheese, ¼ teaspoonful of salt and a drop of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=
   to each yolk of egg. Cream all together and refill egg white. Cut
   each egg half into four quarter pieces and place on lettuce leaves.
   Arrange the Appetizer Dressing in a glass in center of plate. Serve
   with oyster fork.


                          BEET BALL APPETIZER

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Cut small balls from a cooked beet with a fancy potato ball
   cutter, or cut a small beet into quarters and recut each quarter
   into suitable sizes. Place the cut beets in a bowl and cover with
   vinegar. Chill. When ready to serve drain off vinegar and roll each
   piece of beet in finely grated cheese. Arrange on lettuce with the
   Appetizer Dressing in a glass in the center of the plate and serve
   with an oyster fork.


                           SARDINE APPETIZER

   fork and arrange on lettuce with the Appetizer Dressing in a glass
   in the center of the plate.

   Arrange small canned shrimps on lettuce leaves, place the Appetizer
   Dressing in a glass at one side or the center of the plate and serve
   with an oyster fork. Dip each shrimp and leaf in the Appetizer
   Dressing just before it is eaten.


                          MUSHROOM APPETIZER

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Remove the stems from fresh mushrooms, peel the caps and cook in
   slowly boiling, salted water for ten or fifteen minutes. If canned
   mushrooms are used, drain, remove stems and cook slowly in freshly
   boiling, salted water for five minutes. Drain the mushrooms, cool
   and place in ice box to chill. When ready to serve, arrange the
   mushrooms on crisp lettuce leaves and place the Appetizer Dressing
   in a glass in the center of the plate. Serve with an oyster fork.
   Each mushroom and lettuce leaf are dipped in the dressing just
   before eating.

   to each cup 1 teaspoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.

   NOTE.--Canned or bottled clam bouillon may be used in this recipe in
          place of the clams. In this case, use only 2 cupfuls of water
          and 2 cupfuls of the canned clam bouillon.

    HOW TO IMPROVE DRESSINGS AND GRAVIES WITH LEA & PERRINS' SAUCE


After all, there are only a certain number of meats and fishes--and a
tiresomely small number, too, we often think. But the thing that makes
them seem more varied--the different feature of each is the dressing
or gravy that is served with them--the dressing which is made through
the inimitable flavor of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=, a distinguishing
addition to the dish.

The zest, the piquancy, the keen edge which =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=
gives to a dressing or gravy has long been known and used to advantage
by the high-salaried chefs of our luxurious restaurants and hotels.
And now that the chef's secret is known, every homemaker has at her
fingers' ends the basic knowledge for creating from one or two recipes
an infinite variety of rich, delicious dressings that will transform
the plainest food and make the simplest home meal an appetizing repast.

Foods that are too dry can be bettered with a thin dressing--enhanced
by the addition of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=; for more moist foods
a thicker gravy, also seasoned with Lea & Perrins' Sauce, should be
added. Plain dishes may be embellished, rich dishes "toned down" with
contrasting flavors.

But whether the dressing be thick or thin, mild or rich, the addition
of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= improves beyond your expectation the
recipe wherein it is used. Its flavor cannot be imitated, and it has
never been equalled. It is the original Worcestershire--and the only
all-perfect seasoning.

=Lea & Perrins= are the sole manufacturers of the Original
Worcestershire Sauce. Be sure to add =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= to all
recipes.


                     DIFFERENT KINDS OF DRESSINGS

There are two big classes of dressings, brown and white. The brown
dressings are usually made with meat juices or extracts known as
"stock," or by first browning the flour which is used to thicken them.
The white or cream dressings are made with white stock, the water in
which vegetables, onion, celery, rice, chicken or mutton have been
cooked, milk or cream as the liquid ingredient, and thickened with
white flour. The brown dressings are more frequently served with meats,
poultry and game, the white or cream dressings with fish and vegetables.

Dressings are also named by the main ingredient from which they gain
their flavor, as Mushroom Dressing, Tomato Dressing, Mint Dressing,
Cheese Dressing.

Other dressings are classified by the ingredient with which they are
thickened, as Flour and Butter Dressings, Cornstarch Dressings, Egg
Dressings and Drawn Butter Dressings.


      HOW AND WHEN TO SEASON DRESSINGS WITH LEA & PERRINS' SAUCE

To procure the full zest, piquancy and flavor of =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce= in seasoning any dressing or gravy, you must add the Lea &
Perrins' Sauce just before removing the dressing from the fire. If
the dressing must stand for any length of time, do not add =Lea &
Perrins' Sauce= until just before serving time.

The proportion of LEA & PERRINS' SAUCE to add to meat
dressings and gravies is, for an average taste, about two teaspoonfuls
of =Lea & Perrins'= to every cupful of dressing. To delicate
white stock dressings and vegetable sauces, in which the flavor of the
vegetable should dominate, use one-half of a teaspoonful of =Lea &
Perrins' Sauce= to every cupful of dressing.

When such vegetables as onion, bay leaf, carrots or other highly
seasoned vegetables are used in a sauce, they should be cooked in
the butter or fat with which the sauce is made before the liquid is
added. But if the vegetable which is used in the dressing is to be
retained in the sauce, it is frequently added after the dressing has
been completed. This is the case when chopped olives, asparagus tips,
mushrooms and other vegetables are used.


                            BROWN DRESSINGS


                         BASIC BROWN DRESSING

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    2 teaspoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    2 tablespoonfuls of butter.
    3 tablespoonfuls of flour.
    ½ teaspoonful of salt.
    1 cupful of brown meat stock or other liquid.[1]

   Melt the butter, remove from fire and stir in flour until smooth;
   reheat and again remove from fire. Slowly stir in the liquid, which
   may be meat juice, stock, or bouillon broth. Return to fire and
   allow sauce to boil for two or three minutes. Add the =Lea & Perrins'
   Sauce=, and serve at once. This sauce is good with roasted meats,
   croquettes or stews.

[Footnote 1: STOCK.--When brown meat stock or white vegetable stock
     is mentioned in a recipe, it means the water in which the meat or
     vegetable was cooked. In case of roasting or broiling, the juices,
     which cook out of the meat are used.]

   Heat 12 oysters until their edges begin to curl. Drain off the
   liquor and use it in making the Basic White Dressing. If there is
   not enough oyster liquor to make one cupful, add white vegetable
   or cereal stock to it. Make the White Dressing as usual and when
   ready to serve add the oysters finely chopped. Serve with baked or
   boiled fish, or fish croquettes or roasted fowl. This also makes a
   delicious sauce to pour over stewed celery or panned mushrooms.

   stirring smooth. Return to fire and boil for three minutes. Remove
   from fire but keep pan on warm part of stove and beat in the rest of
   the butter, adding it a teaspoonful at a time. This last part must
   be done very carefully or a good butter sauce cannot be obtained.
   Add the _Lea & Perrins' Sauce_. Serve with fish, cauliflower,
   asparagus or other fresh vegetables.

    ¼ teaspoonful of salt.
    ½ cupful of boiling water.
    Juice of ½ lemon.

   Cream the butter, add the egg yolks, well beaten, one at a time,
   and cream them thoroughly into the butter. Add the salt and boiling
   water and cook over hot water, stirring constantly until the sauce
   thickens; add the lemon juice last and remove from the fire. Add the
   =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Do not cook the sauce too rapidly as there
   is danger of it separating. If it does, remove at once to a pan of
   cold water and beat vigorously. Serve with asparagus, cauliflower,
   baked or boiled fish.

                          CHOWDERS AND SOUPS

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

In soups and chowders, where herbs and spices are such an important
element, =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=, an unusual blending of many
spices and flavors, forms the finest possible addition. It will blend
with whatever herb, spice or vegetable the recipe requires, and in
cases where certain spices are hard to obtain it will, with its own
inimitable piquancy, give the dish a perfect, complete and unequalled
flavor.

In earlier days the fishermen each brought their own share of fish to
the big family caldron, and when the dish, which contained biscuits,
onions and a "hodge-podge" of other vegetables, was finished, the
members of the family received an equal share. So a real genuine
chowder should be composed of fish, although we have to-day many
combinations of vegetable chowders.


                             FISH CHOWDER

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    3 pounds of fish.
    ¼ pound of salt pork.
    10 large potatoes.
    1 onion.
    12 soda crackers.
    Salt.
    3 cupfuls of white stock or rice water.
    3 tablespoonfuls of flour.
    4 tablespoonfuls of butter.

   Any fresh, white fish may be used. Skin the fish, remove the fleshy
   part and cover the bones, head and skin with water. Let simmer for
   half an hour. Add the onion with the salt pork, both cut in small
   pieces. Strain this liquid through a fine strainer and pour over the
   white flaky part of the fish.

   Add the potatoes cut in small pieces, salt, and simmer until the
   potatoes are tender. Then add the white stock or rice water and the
   soda crackers cut in half and spread with part of the butter.

   Melt the rest of butter. Stir in the flour and add part of the
   liquid stock from the fish to make a smooth paste. Pour this back
   into the chowder to thicken it. Add the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
   Serve in soup plates or from a soup tureen.

   For this use 20 clams in place of the fish in the above recipe. Sort
   and wash them thoroughly. Allow to stand in cold water for half an
   hour, drain off the water, straining it through several thicknesses
   of cheese cloth. Scald the clams in this water and use the water
   in place of the stock or rice water in making the chowder. Make a
   sauce from the clam liquor, the butter and the flour, and add the
   potatoes, clams, onion and =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= to this. Add
   crackers last.

   The attractive garnishings which are served in soups in the big
   hotels are very easy to prepare at home and add a touch of luxury
   that more than pays for the trouble put into their making.

                              CHAPTER IV

     CROQUETTES, TIMBALES, CASSEROLES, STEWS AND OTHER MEAT DISHES

                 =Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce=


One of the greatest problems in the average household is what to do
with meat, fish or vegetables which are of too small a quantity to
serve alone and yet too worth-while to be wasted. Deliciously seasoned
with =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=, croquettes, cutlets, meat cakes or
creamed dishes, served in attractive bread and pastry cases, not only
help to keep down the meat bill, but also to keep up the family's
enthusiasm for mother's cooking. By forming the well-known cone-shaped
croquette into a cylinder-shaped or a crescent-shaped cutlet, and
serving it with any one of the delicious Spanish, Creole, Tomato or
Mushroom Dressings given in Chapter II, an old recipe is made into a
new dinner surprise.


                      BASIC RECIPE FOR CROQUETTES

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    2 tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    4 tablespoonfuls of butter.
    8 tablespoonfuls of flour.
    1⅓ cupfuls of stock or rice water.
    ½ teaspoonful of salt.
    2 cupfuls of cooked meat.
    1 egg.
    Bread crumbs.

   Melt the butter, add the salt, remove from fire and stir in the
   flour until smooth. Add the stock or rice water slowly, stirring
   constantly, until all is added and boil for five minutes, or until
   thick and creamy. Add the cooked meat, ground, the =Lea & Perrins'
   Sauce=, and cool.

   When thoroughly chilled, pat mixture into desired cylinder or cutlet
   shape and roll in bread crumbs. Beat the egg until well blended,
   adding to it 1 tablespoonful of melted butter and 3 tablespoonfuls
   of water. Dip the croquette in this egg mixture, roll in the bread
   crumbs again, and put into the ice-box for an hour or more to harden
   before frying.

   Fry in deep fat or oil which will brown a cube of bread to a golden
   brown in 40 seconds. Do not fry croquettes for more than 40 seconds.
   Drain in frying basket or on brown paper.

   If desired, pour 2 tablespoonfuls of oil or melted fat over the
   unfried croquettes and bake in a very hot oven for from five to
   eight minutes, dressing occasionally with more oil if necessary.

   Serve with Tomato, Cheese, Mushroom or Hollandaise sauce given in
   Chapter II.

   If croquettes have been shaped into cutlets, a macaroni stick is
   usually stuck in the pointed end to imitate a chop bone.


                            VEAL CROQUETTES

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   A delicious combination calls for 1 cupful of cooked and cubed veal
   and ½ cupful of rice in place of the meat required in the above
   recipe. Proceed as usual, shaping the croquette into cutlet or chop
   shape. Serve with a Tomato, Spanish, Creole or a Mushroom dressing.


                            CHICKEN CUTLETS

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   For this use 1½ cupfuls of cooked cubed chicken, or 1 cupful of
   chicken and ½ cupful of cooked sweetbreads, celery or mushrooms as
   desired, in the Basic Croquette recipe. Serve with White, Celery or
   Oyster dressing given on page 10.

    2 tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    4 cupfuls of cooked rice.
    ¼ cupful of grated cheese.
    2 eggs.
    Bread crumbs.

   Add the grated cheese to the rice and bind the mixture together
   with 1 well-beaten egg to which 2 tablespoonfuls of water has been
   added. Add the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. If too stiff, add a little
   more water, form into croquettes, roll in bread crumbs, beaten egg
   and bread crumbs again and chill. Fry in fat hot enough to brown a
   cube of bread in 40 seconds. Drain and serve with Spanish or Creole
   dressing. These croquettes may form the basis of a luncheon menu or
   may be served as a vegetable or side dish for dinner.


                          MACARONI CROQUETTES

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Cut cooked macaroni into fine pieces, and measure four cupfuls.
   Add ½ cupful of grated cheese, bind the mixture together with 1
   well-beaten egg, add 2 tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=, a
   little more water if the mixture is too stiff to mold, shape into
   croquettes, chill and fry as usual.


                      PEANUT OR WALNUT CROQUETTES

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Use 4 cupfuls of ground peanuts or walnuts in place of meat in the
   Basic Croquette recipe. Add enough of the croquette sauce to the
   nuts to make them easy to mold. Shape into croquettes, roll in bread
   crumbs, egg and crumbs again and chill. Fry as usual.


                        SWEET POTATO CROQUETTES

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   These are made the same way as the rice croquettes, using sweet
   potatoes in place of the rice in the Rice Croquettes recipe and
   omitting the cheese.


                          MUSHROOM CROQUETTES

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   For these use 2 cupfuls of chopped mushrooms in making the Basic
   Croquette recipe. Add to them just enough of the croquette sauce to
   mold firmly together. Shape and fry as usual. Serve with a Cream,
   Hollandaise or Bearnaise Sauce.


                            SALMON CUTLETS

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Use 2 cupfuls of canned salmon and 2 cupfuls of cooked rice, adding
   2½ tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=, ½ teaspoonful of salt
   and 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice. Bind together with an egg and
   shape into croquettes, rolling in bread crumbs and beaten egg as
   usual. Fry and serve with Tomato, Bearnaise or Hollandaise Sauce.


                             FISH CUTLETS

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Proceed as in making Salmon Cutlets, using the same proportions of
   any preferred cooked fish.


                          SURPRISE CROQUETTES

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Press into the center of fish or meat croquettes, just before
   rolling in the bread crumbs, a raw oyster, a cooked mushroom, a
   stuffed olive or a piece of hard-cooked devilled egg. When the
   croquette is eaten the diner is delighted to find in the center this
   spicy surprise.

   REMEMBER:--_Lea & Perrins' is the Only Original Worcestershire
   Sauce. None of the so-called "Worcestershires" can be used in these
   recipes with good results._


                               TIMBALES

Timbales are in reality very fine croquette mixtures, pressed into
individual molds and poached in hot water or baked in the oven. In
making timbales the meat, fish or vegetable is pounded or mashed until
it is very fine and added to a very thick white sauce. This is poured
into an oiled mold which is lined with buttered bread crumbs, macaroni,
spaghetti, olives, peas or fancy cut pimentos.


                       BASIC SAUCE FOR TIMBALES

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    1 teaspoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    2 tablespoonfuls of butter.
    ½ cupful of flour.
    ½ cupful of boiling water.
    1 egg.
    ¼ teaspoonful of salt.

   Melt the butter and stir in half of the flour. Add half of the
   boiling water, stir until smooth. Add the rest of the flour slowly,
   stirring constantly, so that no lumps will be formed, and the rest
   of the boiling water, and the salt. Cook, stirring constantly to
   prevent scorching, until the whole sauce will leave the pan in one
   thick mass. Remove from fire and beat the egg, which has been well
   beaten, into the mixture. Add =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Allow to
   cool, add desired ingredient and pour into buttered or oiled timbale
   molds and poach in hot water.

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Add 1 cupful of finely picked fish which has been forced through a
   purée strainer to the Basic Timbale Sauce. Add an extra teaspoonful
   of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= and 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice.

   for ten minutes and serve with Hollandaise Sauce.


                             HAM TIMBALES

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Cut cold, boiled ham into fine pieces to make one cupful and run
   through finest cutter of meat chopper. Run again through meat
   chopper and then force through purée strainer. Add this to the Basic
   Timbale Sauce and fill into timbale mold which has been oiled and
   lined with olive rings. Poach in hot water for ten minutes or bake
   in the oven for that time. Serve with Bearnaise sauce and garnish
   with parsley.


                      STEWS AND CASSEROLE DISHES

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

In stews and casserole dishes our object is to make tender by slow,
long cooking the meat selected, besides cooking with it herbs, spices
and vegetables to supplement and flavor it.

Of all the spices and herbs which it is possible to add to these
casserole dishes and stews, there is no seasoning that will produce
just that zestful, appetizing flavor which =Lea & Perrins'
Sauce=--itself a secret blend of the finest spices--gives.

Use it freely in seasoning all kinds of long-cooked meat
dishes--goulashes, pot roasts, ragouts, stews, casseroles and meat
pies. Use it also in making meat loaf and rolled meated dishes, in
croquettes and timbales. In fact, wherever you use meat in cooking,
remember to--

                               BEEF STEW

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    2 tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    3 pounds of stewing beef.
    1 onion.
    1 carrot.
    6 potatoes.
    1 turnip.
    6 cupfuls of water.
    1 green pepper.

   Select a piece of shin meat, the flank end of a roast or a cut of
   the chuck ribs, as these contain fat meat, lean meat and a little
   bone, all of which are necessary to a good stew.

   Cut the meat from the bones, wipe the bones carefully to remove any
   small cracked pieces and place in stewing kettle. Add the 6 cupfuls
   of boiling water.

   Melt a piece of fat, from the meat, in a shallow pan and cook the
   cut onion in it until brown. Slice and brown the carrot and turnip,
   and add to the kettle.

   Braise the meat in these same fat drippings, turning frequently and
   cooking on all sides until white, which closes the meat tubes and
   keeps the juices within the meat during the long, slow cooking that
   follows. Add the meat and the drippings in which it was cooked to
   the stewing kettle. Remove seeds and pulp from pepper and add to the
   stew.

   Simmer slowly for three hours or until the meat is tender. Skim the
   fat from the kettle and remove the bones. Add the potatoes, which
   have been washed, peeled and cut in quarters. Cook until these are
   done and the meat will be ready to serve. Add the =Lea & Perrins'
   Sauce=. Arrange the carrot, turnip, onion, pepper and potato
   around the meat on a platter. Thicken the stock left in the kettle
   with shortening and flour. Add an extra teaspoonful of =Lea &
   Perrins' Sauce=, and serve.


                       RAGOUT OF MUTTON OR LAMB

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    2 tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    3 pounds of mutton or lamb.
    2 onions.
    2 carrots.
    6 potatoes.
    2 cupfuls of tomato juice.
    1 teaspoonful of salt.

   Cube the meat into pieces two inches square and sear in drippings
   from the fat of the meat. Put meat in kettle and cover with water.
   Brown the onion in the drippings and add with salt and drippings to
   meat. Simmer for two hours or more, skim off fat, add the tomato
   juice, the potatoes peeled and cut in quarters and the carrot cubed
   or cut in balls with a potato cutter. Remove meat from stew, place
   on platter surrounded with the vegetables, add the =Lea & Perrins'
   Sauce= to the meat stock, and pour over the meat and vegetables.
   Serve at once.


                           LAMB KIDNEY STEW

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    6 lamb kidneys.
    1 teaspoonful of salt.
    2 tablespoonfuls of drippings.
    2 tablespoonfuls of flour.
    1 cupful of water or meat stock.

   Remove all skin and fat from the kidneys and set them in water to
   cover, to which a handful of salt has been added. Let stand three or
   four hours, or, if possible, over-night. Remove water, put in pan
   with fresh water to cover and slowly bring to boiling point but do
   not boil. Drain and cut into tiny pieces. Brown the drippings and
   sauté the cut kidneys in them. Add the flour and stir until smooth,
   then the water or meat stock slowly, stirring constantly to make a
   smooth gravy. Add the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Pour over toast on a
   hot platter and serve.


                CASSEROLE OF VEAL WITH CARROTS AND PEAS

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    2 pounds of breast of veal.
    2 pieces of salt pork.
    4 carrots.
    1 cupful of peas.
    3 potatoes.
    1 onion.

   Cut the veal into small pieces and sear it in a shallow pan in
   drippings from one piece of the salt pork. Place the veal in a
   glass casserole greased with the salt pork. Brown the onion in the
   salt pork and add to the casserole. Cut the second piece of salt
   pork into small squares and add to casserole. Cover meat with water
   and cook in oven for an hour. Cut the potatoes and carrot into
   dice-shaped pieces. Add these with the peas to the casserole about
   half an hour before it is ready to take from the oven. Blanched rice
   added at the same time is often a welcome addition. When both meat
   and vegetables are tender, add the _Lea & Perrins' Sauce_ and serve
   at once in the dish in which it was baked.


                           ROASTED MEAT LOAF

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    3 cupfuls of finely ground raw meat (about 2 pounds).
    2 cupfuls of soft bread crumbs.
    2 slices of bacon.
    1 cupful of celery.
    1 green pepper.
    1 onion.
    1 egg.

   Mix the finely ground meat with the bread crumbs and celery. Add the
   chopped green pepper, a little salt and pepper, the egg well beaten
   and the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Add enough water to make mixture
   moist and pack into greased brick-shaped pan. Place in ice-box to
   chill and remove when cold to a greased roasting pan, turning the
   loaf out of the mold. Place the bacon cut into thick strips on top
   of the loaf and also slices of the onion. Pour a cupful of thin
   tomato sauce over the whole and roast the meat in a hot oven for
   from fifty minutes to an hour. Serve hot with Tomato Sauce, sliced
   onion and crisp bacon.


                                POLENTA

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    1 cupful of yellow cornmeal.
    2 cupfuls of boiling water.
    2 cupfuls of cold water.
    1 teaspoonful of salt.
    2 tablespoonfuls of butter.
    4 tablespoonfuls of grated cheese.

   Cover the cornmeal with the cold water and let stand five minutes.
   Add to the boiling water and cook directly over the fire for half an
   hour. Add the salt, the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=, the grated cheese
   and the butter. Cook five minutes more and pour into a buttered
   baking dish and serve with Creole Sauce given on page 9.


                             FRIED POLENTA

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Allow the polenta to cool, cut into 1-inch squares, roll in egg
   and bread crumbs and fry in deep fat. Serve with Tomato, Creole or
   Spanish Sauce given on pages 9 and 10.

            EGGS, OMELETS, SOUFFLES, CREOLE AND RICE DISHES

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_


It is almost unbelievable until you have tried it--to discover how
surprisingly delicious just a drop or two of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= can
make a soft-boiled breakfast egg taste. And when you have tried it, you
will want furthermore to fry and poach, scramble, omelet and soufflé
all of the eggs that you cook with just a little of Lea & Perrins'
Sauce added as an inimitable seasoning.


                            SOFT-BOILED EGG

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   There are several ways of cooking a soft-boiled egg--the best of
   which is not to boil it at all.

   Use one pint of _boiling_ water for each egg to be cooked. Carefully
   lower the egg into the water, cover the saucepan and let stand on
   back of stove for eight or ten minutes. Do not increase or diminish
   heat. The white of the egg will be tender and the yolk firm all the
   way through, instead of the yolk being partly uncooked and the white
   very tough as is the case with a three-minute boiled egg.

   Still another way is to put the egg on in cold water and remove as
   soon as the water boils.

   Remove egg from shell to a hot egg cup and add a large piece
   of butter, a bit of salt and 2 or 3 drops of =Lea & Perrins'
   Sauce=. Blend well and serve at once.


                              FRIED EGGS

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Eggs should never be fried, as this method of cooking, like boiling,
   toughens the albumen. However, if your family must have fried eggs,
   you will find the addition of a teaspoonful of =Lea & Perrins'
   Sauce= to the fat in which they are cooked a decided improvement
   to the eggs. Put the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= on the table and
   serve with the eggs.


                             POACHED EGGS

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Brush a heavy iron frying pan with oil and add boiling water to the
   depth of an inch or more. Add 1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins'
   Sauce= and a pinch of salt. Break fresh eggs into a saucer and
   gently slip from saucer to water. Cook without allowing water to
   boil until the egg is firm. Remove with skimmer or quickly dip piece
   of toast under egg and lift out at once. Drain, then put on hot
   plate and serve. If one is fortunate enough to have an egg poacher,
   poaching eggs is an even simpler matter. Serve with _Lea & Perrins'
   Sauce_ on the table.


                               BAKED EGG

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Grease an individual glass or fire-proof ramekin with oil or butter
   and break an egg into it. Sprinkle with salt and season with a few
   drops of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Bake surrounded by water in a
   moderate oven for from five to ten minutes and serve with =Lea &
   Perrins' Sauce= at the table.


                              EGG IN NEST

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Beat the white of an egg with a sprinkling of salt until light and
   frothy and pile on top of a piece of toast in an individual ovenware
   dish. Make a slight dent on the top of the egg white and carefully
   place the yolk in the center; add a drop of =Lea & Perrins'
   Sauce=. Place in a pan of water and cook in a moderate oven until
   yolk and white are set. Serve with =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= at
   the table.


                              SHIRRED EGG

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Add 1 teaspoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= to 2 tablespoonfuls
   of finely chopped ham or bacon and 2 tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs.
   Add enough oil or butter to blend well, and press against the
   buttered sides and bottom of an individual baking dish. Break an egg
   into the dish and sprinkle top with buttered bread crumbs. Bake in
   a moderate oven, the dish being surrounded with hot water. Serve in
   the dish in which it was baked with =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= at
   the table. Mashed potato, spinach or tomato are often used to fill
   sides and bottom of ramekin.


                            SCRAMBLED EGGS

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   In Scrambling eggs, great care should be exercised in the cooking,
   the mixture being of a custard-like, creamy consistency when
   finished, and not dry and lumpy as some scrambled eggs become. The
   secret is in allowing the egg to cook as much in the heat of the pan
   as over the fire. Keep stirring the mixture constantly removing the
   pan from the fire if the eggs seem to get too dry in any one spot.

   In scrambling eggs, beat the egg until light and add for each egg
   used, 2 tablespoonfuls of water and a few drops of =Lea & Perrins'
   Sauce=.


                         OMELETS AND SOUFFLES

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   An omelet may be made with or without separating the yolks and
   whites of the eggs, the one being called a plain--the other a
   fluffy omelet. A soufflé is a fluffy omelet made with a white sauce
   foundation and baked in the oven.

   Cheese, tomatoes, chopped meats and vegetables are all attractive
   additions to these dishes, but, no matter what else may be added,
   =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= as a seasoning for omelets and soufflés
   cannot be equalled.


                             PLAIN OMELET

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    3 eggs.
    3 tablespoonfuls of water.
    ¼ teaspoonful of salt.
    1 tablespoonful of butter.

   Beat the eggs without separating and add the water. Add the salt,
   the butter melted and the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.

   Heat a heavy iron frying pan and grease well with oil, bacon fat
   or shortening. Pour in the egg and lower heat under pan. Tilt pan
   backward and forward and from side to side, allowing liquid to run
   under egg as it cooks. When cooked throughout, run spatulate or
   knife under omelet and roll it into a roll. Turn out on platter and
   serve with toast or any desired addition.


                             FLUFFY OMELET

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    1 tablespoonful of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    4 eggs.
    6 tablespoonfuls of water.
    ½ teaspoonful of salt.
    1 tablespoonful of butter.

   Separate the eggs; add the water, salt and melted butter to the
   yolks. Also add the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Beat the whites
   until light and frothy and carefully fold them into the yolks.

   Grease a heavy iron pan with bacon fat and pour in the omelet. Lower
   heat under pan and let cook slowly until brown on the bottom and
   almost dry. Place lid over pan and let dry on top, or place in oven
   for two minutes.

   Cut the omelet lightly on the top and fold over without breaking
   under part. Turn out on platter and serve at once.


                             TOMATO OMELET

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Spread sliced and fried tomatoes in between the omelet before
   folding and pour the tomato gravy, which cooked out of the tomatoes
   in frying, over the finished dish.


                            SPANISH OMELET

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Just before folding omelet over, spread with the following mixture
   and pour what is left, over the whole omelet after it is placed
   on the platter: 2 finely chopped onions, 1 chopped green pepper,
   a few cut olives, and, if possible, a few mushrooms. Sauté these
   ingredients in 2 teaspoonfuls of oil, add 1 cupful of tomato juice
   and spread in between and pour over omelet.


                              CORN OMELET

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Spread the omelet with cooked corn before folding.


                           VEGETABLE OMELET

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Spread the omelet with any desired combination of, or individually
   cooked vegetable, as peas, carrots, asparagus, cauliflower, onions.
   This also helps to use up any vegetables of which too small a
   quantity has been left to permit using them alone. The vegetable
   used should be heated in a little butter or cooking oil to which a
   few drops of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= have been added.


                             CHEESE OMELET

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Sprinkle grated cheese over the omelet before and after folding. Or
   add ½ cupful of grated cheese to the omelet in the making.


                             BACON OMELET

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Fry four or five slices of bacon until crisp. Use the bacon
   drippings in place of the butter in making and frying the omelet.
   Spread the bacon, cut into small pieces, on the omelet before
   folding. Garnish the plate with bacon. Serve at once.


                              HAM OMELET

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Chop previously fried ham very fine and reheat in some fat to which
   =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= has been added. Spread on omelet.


                            SARDINE OMELET

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Sauté some sardines in a little cooking oil to which =Lea & Perrins'
   Sauce= has been added and spread on omelet before folding.


                    KIDNEY OR CHICKEN LIVER OMELET

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Reheat previously cooked chicken livers or kidneys in a little
   cooking oil to which =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= has been added and
   spread on omelet before folding. Pour a little kidney or liver gravy
   over omelet.


                             PLAIN SOUFFLÉ

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    1 tablespoonful of Lea & Perrins' Sauce.
    2 tablespoonfuls of shortening.
    2 tablespoonfuls of flour.
    ½ cupful of milk or water.
    3 eggs.

   Melt the shortening, stir in the flour until smooth, remove from the
   fire and slowly stir in the liquid. Add the salt and cook for three
   or four minutes or until a thick, smooth sauce is made. Beat the
   yolks of the eggs until creamy and add to the sauce. Remove from the
   fire and add the stiffly-beaten whites of the eggs. Add the =Lea &
   Perrins' Sauce=. Pour into a buttered baking dish, place dish in a
   pan of hot water and bake in a slow oven for twenty or twenty-five
   minutes. Serve at once.

   The dish in which a soufflé is baked should be broad and wide,
   rather than high and narrow, to prevent the soufflé from rising
   too high in the center and then falling. It is a big help to pin a
   buttered paper band around a soufflé dish before baking, so that it
   will rise easily without overflowing.


                            CHEESE SOUFFLÉ

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   For this, use tomato juice in place of the milk or water in the
   plain Soufflé recipe and add 1 cupful of grated cheese just before
   folding in the egg whites. Pour into a buttered baking dish and bake
   as usual.


                           MUSHROOM SOUFFLE

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Use 1 cupful of mushroom gravy in making the sauce for the Basic
   Soufflé and add 1 cupful of finely chopped mushrooms before folding
   in the egg whites.


                       OLIVE AND PEPPER SOUFFLE

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   Add ¼ cupful of finely chopped olives and the same amount of finely

                         CHAFING DISH SUPPERS

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_


                       CHAFING DISH SUPPER MENU

       _To be prepared with Lea & Perrins' Sauce in the cooking_

                        Welsh or Tomato Rarebit
                                  on
                           Toasted Crackers
              Devilled Ham, Celery and Lettuce Sandwiches
                    Salted Nuts      Stuffed Olives
                                Coffee
                                  or
                   Ginger Ale Orange Juice High Ball

At no other time do we so desire tasty, spicy piquant food as when we
have a chafing dish supper. And there is no other dish wherein the
supreme quality of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= shows off to better
advantage than in the chafing dish recipe. For the midnight college
spread--the Welsh, Cheese or Tomato Rarebits--for the kitchenette
apartment dinner of Creamed Dried Beef, Ham, Shrimps or Eggs, or
for the simple home Sunday night supper of Creamed Oysters, Chicken
or Chicken à la King--=Lea & Perrins' Sauce=--the original
Worcestershire--forms the unsurpassed, the perfect seasoning.

A chafing dish is composed of two flat pans, one called the blazer,
the other the hot-water pan. The usual chafing dish recipe directs the
first cooking of the material to be directly over the heat--and is
finished and the food kept hot over the hot-water pan.

The chafing dish, particularly if it is one in which alcohol is the
heating element, should always be placed on a tray, to avoid any danger
from fire or a possible "boiling over" of the food. A wooden or chafing
dish spoon is a help although not essential. The butter, flour and
things necessary for the dish to be made should be measured and placed
on the tray besides the chafing dish so that the recipe may be made
up without hurry or getting up and down from the table. With electric
grills the toast may be made under the grill while the other things are
cooking above.


                             WELSH RAREBIT

    2 cupfuls of grated American cheese.
    ½ cupful of cream.

   Buttered soda crackers or toast.

   Melt the butter in the blazer over the hot-water pan, in which
   the water should be boiling. Add the grated cheese and the cream
   alternately, a little at a time, allowing the cheese to melt slowly.
   Add the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.

   Keep over the hot water while serving and serve on buttered crackers
   or toast. Serve =Lea & Perrins'= on the side, to be used for a
   flavor to suit each taste.

   tablespoonfuls of butter directly over the chafing dish flame or
   grill and sauté the mushrooms and peppers in it. Add the rest of the
   butter and slowly stir in the flour. Add the rice water, stirring
   all until smooth. Cook until it boils for one minute, then place
   in the pan over the hot water, add the chicken and cook for five

   given in the Creamed Egg recipe to make a sauce, adding the shrimps
   after the sauce has been cooked for one minute. Cook over hot water
   for ten minutes before serving.

    6 hard-cooked eggs.
    ½ teaspoonful of salt.

   the hard-cooked eggs into small pieces, saving out the yolk of one.
   Add the chopped egg to the white sauce and continue the cooking over
   hot water. Add the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= and the salt. Serve on
   points of toast and garnish with the yolk of 1 egg rubbed through a
   fine strainer and sprinkle on top of the whole dish.

   before serving.

    2 tablespoonfuls of butter.
    1 cupful of oyster liquor.

   Heat the oysters directly over the flame until the edges curl. Add
   the butter and flour, which has been mixed with a little of the
   oyster liquor to make a smooth paste, and when blended add the rest
   of the liquid to make a white sauce. Continue cooking over hot water

                           SANDWICH FILLINGS

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_


Delicious and different sandwich fillings, for picnics or party
refreshments, depend for their distinction, not so much upon the meat
or cheese which is used as a filling, but upon the seasoning. =Lea &
Perrins' Sauce=, which is so delicious with meat or cheese, adds an
unequalled and spicy touch in the seasoning of sandwiches.

Bread for sandwiches should not be over a day old. In buttering
the bread, always cream the butter first in a bowl and then spread
the bread evenly with the softened butter. If saving crusts is not
necessary, it is very nice to remove these, cutting the bread into
fancy shaped slices. If a large number of sandwiches are made up for a
reception, it is best to wrap them in a wet cheese-cloth and keep them
wrapped until ready to serve.

   too near the edge. Place bread on top and wrap each sandwich in
   individual wax papers.

=Lea & Perrins' Sauce=, the original Worcestershire flavoring.

dressing recipes given here. You will be surprised and delighted with
the new, piquant taste which =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= adds, in a

    ½ cupful of milk.
    1 cupful of oil.
    2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.

   Add the dry ingredients to the well-beaten yolks of the eggs. Beat
   until well blended and then add the milk, vinegar and oil. Cook in
   the top of a double boiler until smooth and thick and beat with an
   egg-beater during the cooking so that it will not curdle.

   Remove from the fire as soon as it reaches the correct consistency.
   Plunge pan into cold water and continue beating. Add =Lea & Perrins'
   Sauce=. Put into preserve jar for convenient keeping in the ice-box.


                   A SALAD DRESSING MADE WITHOUT OIL

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

   By using 2 egg yolks and 1 whole egg and 1 cupful of cream instead
   of ½ cupful of milk, a delicious salad dressing may be made from the
   above recipe without using any oil at all.

   These cooked salad dressings may be varied just as the mayonnaise by
   the addition of olives, peppers, parsley and other ingredients used
   as directed under the Mayonnaise Dressing recipes.

   & Perrins'= Sauce and 1 tablespoonful of olive oil. Stir well and
   add the vinegar. As the dressing thickens through stirring, add the
   rest of the olive oil and continue beating. This may be poured into
   a bottle and kept in the ice-box, beating or shaking again before it
   is served.

   In making an oil mayonnaise, alternate in thinning from time to time
   with =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= and vinegar or lemon juice, until amount

                              CHAPTER IX

           CATSUPS, CHUTNEYS, PICKLES AND HOME-MADE RELISHES

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_


In pickling, we think first of Grandmother and the delicious catsups,
pickles and chutneys which she served with Sunday-night suppers and
wonder why we see these delicious relishes so seldom these days. But we
need not forego our home-made catsups, pickles and chow-chows, nor even
find them less relishing because we have no herb garden, for in _=Lea
& Perrins' Sauce=_ we have the most complete--the most ideal and
perfect relish seasoning.

=Lea & Perrins'= Original Worcestershire is in itself a secret
blending of spices which will give to any home-made relish the keen
edge--the snap--the zest it requires.

Use =Lea & Perrins' Sauce= in seasoning catsups, chow-chows,
pickles, vinegars, chutneys, piccalilli and chilli sauce relishes--it
is the unequalled spice for them all.


                       AN UNCOOKED TOMATO CATSUP

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    4 tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    2 quarts of red ripe tomatoes.
    1 cupful of onions.
    ¼ cupful of salt.
    1 cupful of sugar.
    3 cupfuls of vinegar.

   Dip the tomatoes quickly into rapidly boiling water, dip in and out
   of cold water and peel. Put into large preserving kettle and add
   the onions well chopped. Mash these two together and add the salt,
   sugar, vinegar and last, the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Thoroughly
   sterilize catsup bottles by boiling and fill with the cold catsup.
   Cork loosely. Place bottles on a wire rack, stand in a pan which
   allows rapidly boiling water to come to the neck of the bottle, and
   boil or sterilize for thirty minutes. Some experts claim this final
   "water bath" to be unnecessary, but the inexperienced preserver will
   have better success if the last cooking is performed.

   For perfect keeping and especially if the catsups are made up to
   sell, the corks should be driven in tightly and the bottles sealed
   with sealing wax or melted paraffin as soon as they are removed from
   the water bath. Stamping the soft wax or paraffin with a special
   sealing stamp also helps to give an identifying and distinguishing
   mark to the product.


                            MUSHROOM CATSUP

                 _Improved with Lea & Perrins' Sauce_

    3 tablespoonfuls of =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=.
    2 quarts of mushrooms.
    1 cupful of vinegar.
    1 tablespoonful of salt.
    1 tablespoonful of mustard.

   Peel the mushrooms, cut into small pieces, cover with ½ cupful of
   boiling water and cook until quite tender and soft. Mash through a
   fine purée strainer or sieve and add the vinegar, salt, and last the
   =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Cook from half to three-quarters of an
   hour or until of the consistency of catsup and pour into sterilized
   bottles and seal at once. Label and store.

   Peel the tomatoes and cut fine. Peel and chop the onions, and skin
   and chop the apples, and place all of these ingredients in a heavy
   iron kettle. Add the brown sugar and salt. Cook for half an hour,
   add the vinegar, boil ten minutes longer, add the =Lea & Perrins'
   Sauce=. Pour into sterilized jars and seal.

    ½ cupful of tart currant jelly.
    4 lemons.
    2 cupfuls of sugar.
    1 tablespoonful of salt.
    1 cupful of ground raisins.

   Skin and cut the apples fine. Peel and cut the onion; remove seeds
   and pulp from the peppers and chop fine. Put all these ingredients
   into a heavy iron kettle, add the jelly, the juice of the lemons,
   the sugar, salt and vinegar and simmer slowly for one hour. Add the
   raisins last. Cook an hour longer, stirring to prevent sticking.
   Then add the =Lea & Perrins' Sauce=. Pour into sterilized pint
   or quart preserving jars, seal, label and store with your other
   preserves.


                           RED PEPPER RELISH

   in hot sterilized jars. Add the sugar, salt and =Lea & Perrins'

    1 teaspoonful curry powder.

   Cut tomatoes into quarters; cut cucumbers into small pieces; cut
   cabbage, but do not chop it fine; separate cauliflower head into
   small flowerettes; cut onions; also cut peppers and celery into
   small strips. Soak this vegetable chow in salt and water to cover
   over-night. In the morning bring them to the boiling point in the
   same brine and drain. Mix the mustard and flour in a large kettle
   and add enough vinegar to make a smooth paste. Add the curry powder,
   brown sugar and the rest of the vinegar. Heat until the mixture is
   thick and add the drained vegetable chow. Cook for five minutes. Add

   removing seeds and pulp. Soak the vegetables in a brine of salt and
   water over-night, drain and stand in clear water for two hours.
   Drain and scald in one-half of the quantity of vinegar used in the
   dressing and the same amount of water.

   together. Add the vinegar slowly, stirring to make a smooth paste.

   Drain the vegetables and pour the mustard dressing over them while
   it is hot. Mix well and pack in sterilized jars. Seal, but not too
   tightly, and simmer in hot water for twenty minutes. Remove, tighten
   jar lids and label.

            Worcestershire sauce. None of the so-called
            "Worcestershires" can be used in these recipes
            with good results._

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
